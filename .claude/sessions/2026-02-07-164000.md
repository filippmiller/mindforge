# Session Notes: Project Initialization & Railway Deployment

**Date:** 2026-02-07 16:40
**Area:** Infrastructure/Setup
**Type:** feature
**Log Entry:** `.claude/agent-log.md` (entry at 2026-02-07 16:40)

## Context

User shared a Claude.ai conversation URL containing the full MindForge project — a voice-first AI brainstorming platform. Task was to extract all files, create a GitHub repo, push, and deploy to Railway.

## What Was Done

### 1. File Extraction from Claude.ai
- Opened shared conversation in Playwright browser
- Discovered the API endpoint `claude.ai/api/chat_snapshots/{id}` returns full conversation data including `create_file` tool calls with `file_text` content
- Extracted 40 file paths and contents programmatically
- User also downloaded a zip archive from the conversation, which was used for final extraction

### 2. GitHub Repository
- Created `.gitignore` for Python + Node
- Initialized git repo at `C:\dev\love\mindforge`
- Created GitHub repo `filippmiller/mindforge` (public) via `gh repo create`
- Pushed 41 files, 3,150 insertions

### 3. Railway Deployment
- Created Railway project `mindforge` via CLI (`railway init`)
- Opened Railway dashboard in browser, navigated to project
- Added GitHub Repository service linked to `filippmiller/mindforge`
- Configured: root directory `/backend`, start command `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}`, generated public domain
- Deployment succeeded, service is online

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| Extract via API not DOM clicks | DOM clicking was unreliable (element interception), API returned structured data with full file contents | Could have clicked through 40+ file artifacts one by one |
| Deploy backend only initially | Backend is the core service; frontend needs separate build pipeline | Could have deployed as monorepo with Nixpacks |
| SQLite for MVP database | Matches the project's `.env.example` defaults; simple, no external service needed | Could add PostgreSQL on Railway |

## Files Changed (Full List)

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 40 project files | Created | Full MindForge project extracted from Claude.ai conversation |
| `.gitignore` | Created | Python + Node ignore patterns |

## Database Impact

| Table | Action | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `sessions` | Schema defined | SQLite, created on first run via `init_db()` |
| `conversation_turns` | Schema defined | Stores conversation history per session |
| `whitepapers` | Schema defined | Stores whitepaper content per session |
| `learned_rules` | Schema defined | Self-learning rules from brainstorming sessions |

## Testing

- [x] Backend health check — `/docs` returns Swagger UI (200)
- [ ] API endpoint testing — needs `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set
- [ ] Frontend build — not yet deployed

## Commits

- `28f8e6f` — Initial commit: MindForge brainstorming engine MVP

## Gotchas & Notes for Future Agents

- The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in Railway Variables still has the placeholder value `sk-ant-your-key-here`. User must update it manually.
- Frontend is NOT deployed yet — only backend service exists on Railway. Frontend would need a second service with root `/frontend`.
- The project uses SQLite (`mindforge.db`) which is ephemeral on Railway (no persistent volume attached). For production, either attach a volume or switch to PostgreSQL.
- The zip archive is still at `C:\dev\love\mindforge-project.zip` — can be cleaned up.
- Railway auto-detected Python 3.13.12 and built successfully with Railpack.
